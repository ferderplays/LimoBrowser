If u r about to run it in an IDE, run the "Frame.java" file, cause if u run any other file, it wont work

# How to use:
> **How to reload page?**

> Right click/Left click(depends on what main hand mouse setting you use) the page, and click on the "Reload Page".

> **How to go back?**

> Right click/Left click(depends on what main hand mouse setting you use) the page, and click on the "Go Back".

> **how to go forward?**

> Right click/Left click(depends on what main hand mouse setting you use) the page, and click on the "Go forward"

> **Why don't you implement those actions to the browser itself?**

> I will, but later
